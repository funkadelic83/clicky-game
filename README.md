# clicky-game

This is a React style clicky-game, "Click the Bern".

Click on a picture of Bernie Sanders to begin. The array of Bernie images will be shuffled after each click. Try to remember which ones you've already clicked. If you click an image you haven't clicked yet, you get a point. If you click the same image twice, your score resets!
